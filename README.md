# optimal-control-with-FEMMA
An optimal control framework that combines the finite element method and the method of moving asymptotes for magnetic resonance pulse optimization 

## Description
The Liouville–von Neumann equation is solved using a one-dimensional finite element formulation, which provides a joint solution for spin trajectory and control gradients. Optimization with the Method of Moving Asymptotes, using ensemble fidelities and gradients, converges rapidly to a fidelity of 0.995.
